# SmartParkingSystem
The Standalone application for ML powered Parking facility

Introduction 

In our day to day life, the most common and very evident problem that we are facing in the cities is the traffic. The traffic in metro cities is growing by the minute and people are spending almost half their day in the traffic. This system explicitly allocates and reserves optimal parking spaces to drivers, as opposed to simply guiding them to a space that may not be available by the time it is reached. The allocation is based on each user’s objective function that combines proximity to destination and parking cost while also ensuring that the overall parking capacity is efficiently utilized. The reservation in our “smart parking” system is different from that in the e-parking platform and others. The latter only involves garage space reservations, and there is no attempt at any form of optimality, whereas in our “smart parking” system, drivers may reserve both off-street and on street parking spaces, which are selected to be optimal based on a well-defined objective function structure.


#Machine Learning model
The data that is collected by the application is stored and according to that data a model is made by using the k- clustering algorithm. There are many different types of customers, some of which are people who book a slot and then don’t come or reach late than the time given. Then there are some who are always very punctual and always reach within the time it is booked for. Based on these classifications, the customers are clustered in groups by which they are given respective discounts or some offers.
